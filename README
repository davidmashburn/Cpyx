Cpyx is a very dumb utility to run cython and then gcc.
It can also import and run the result from inlined cython code within python (see CythonInlineTest.py).
I find this immensely helpful for testing simple cython code, especially when using a GUI shell.

For standard (non-inline) usage, you will need to specify the location of your .pyx files (set myPyrexDir or the environment variable 'MYPYREX').
Then call either Cpyx.Cpyx (or Cpyx.CpyxLib if you need to link in an external c file).  File extensions are assumed, so just use the name of the module.

Cpyx has switches for 3 different OS's (windows, linux, mac) for various options, but hard-codes the paths to compiler binaries, etc.
If you have cython or gcc in a non-standard place, you can either place a link in the spot Cpyx is looking for it or just go into Cpyx and edit the path (it's not really that long <500 lines with comments).

It is quite verbose, outputting each command in sequence so you can manually run/modify the compiler commands if you need to.
( That way even if it doesn't quite work, maybe you can use it to help you learn how to use cython and gcc ;) )

I know there are other tools out there to do this same kind of thing (and in much better ways), but this scratches my itch and I thought I'd put it out there. Happy Cythoning!
